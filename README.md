# YouTubeAutoMute
Automatically mutes and skips YouTube ads <br />
Will also allow prepausing videos during the ads, meaning if you pause an ad, the ad will keep playing and the video will pause when it loads in <br />
Load the YouTubeAutoMuter folder as an unpacked extension into Chrome to use <br />
